After finalizing and building the supporting components of our web app, we were left with the most challenging task: generating AI-powered dance choreography. We began our research and came across several frameworks, including React Three.js. However, we quickly realized that it didn't offer the level of flexibility we needed for manipulating 3D models to fit our specific requirements. 

This led us to explore Unity, even though neither of us had any prior experience with it. It was an uphill battle from the start, as we delved into countless YouTube tutorials and articles to get up to speed. Finally, after much trial and error, we managed to set up the modelâ€”a significant milestone that gave us a much-needed boost of confidence.

The following weeks were a whirlwind of learning and experimentation. We spent hours tweaking animations, establishing communication between different components, and fine-tuning every detail to match our vision. Despite the challenges, each small victory felt incredibly rewarding, turning what could have been a daunting process into an exhilarating journey of discovery and growth.
